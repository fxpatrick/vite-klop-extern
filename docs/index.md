1. The Buying Company will make a Purchase Order document, and this Purchase Order document will be sent directly to the Supplier based on the vendor name
2. Overseas or domestic vendors will receive a Purchase Order document that has been requested from buying company, and the vendor will make a shipment document
3. Shipment documents that have been completed by the supplier will be sent directly to buying company and can be used as PIB documents by buying company later

## Why do you need to create a shipment?
Because when you create a shipment document, the document that you create later can be used by internal users for the creation of PIB documents automatically, by utilizing the information contained in the Shipment document, such as Port of Loading, Port of Destination, Total Net Weight, Goods Code, net weight per item, Qty of Goods, Unit of Goods, Type of Goods Packaging, Packaging, Containers, and Complementary Documents such as Invoice & Packing List

## Where the data lead to?
The Shipment document that the supplier creates will be sent directly to the buying company, buying company or supplier can also revise the shipment document if an error occurs during data creation
